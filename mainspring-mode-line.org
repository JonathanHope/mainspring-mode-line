** Overview

mainspring-mode-line is a mode-line for Emacs. It shows the number of the window, whether the buffer is dirty, the name of the buffer, the project if any, the current major mode, a scrollbar, and the coordinates of the cursor.

** Installation

This uses PragmataPro fonts which are non-free. It also relies on projectile and winum.
